# üóìÔ∏è Weekly Planner

**Author:** Gia Bao Bui  
**Purpose:** Technical assignment for IntegraDev ‚Äì Demonstration of object-oriented design, clean architecture, and system evolvability in Java.

## Overview

This desktop application is a modular weekly planner designed with a focus on clean architecture, evolvability, and testability rather than full UI completeness.

Users can create tasks, set their properties, and generate a planned weekly schedule based on task attributes and user preferences (e.g., working hours).

The system's design highlights:

- A domain planner that encapsulates the core planning logic
- A layered architecture (JavaFX UI ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí DAO ‚Üí Database)

---

## Architecture

The application follows a **Layered Architecture** with **Ports & Adapters** pattern, ensuring clean separation of concerns and testability.

```

**Key Architectural Principles:**

- **Domain Layer** (innermost): Contains business logic with no framework dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates use cases and coordinates between UI and domain
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements ports and handles external concerns (database, UI)
- **Dependency Inversion**: Outer layers depend on inner layers through interfaces

## Notes

This submission prioritizes architecture quality, extensibility, and domain design clarity over visual polish. The codebase demonstrates my approach to incremental feature development, clean abstraction, and maintainable OOP design under time constraints.
